'''
Based on measurements of 
* linear acceleration
* angular velocity
by a xSens sensor, this program calculates
* the minimum and maximum cupular displacement in the right horizontal semi-circular canal
* the minimum and maximum linear acceleration in direction of the sensor's on-direction (to the left of the head)
* the final orientation of the wearers head in space.

Output of the cupular displacement is to the file CupularDisplacement.txt
Output of the linear acceleration is to the file MaxAcceleration.txt
All three results are printed to standard output.

By default, sensor data is read from 'Walking_02.txt' in the working directory.
Different paths can be passed to main(dataPath).
